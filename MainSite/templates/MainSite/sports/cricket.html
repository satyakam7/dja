<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">Our cricket team is one of the best college teams in Delhi. The team has great bonding within themselves as well as with other sports. We have always supported young talent and provided opportunities throughout the year to bring out the best out of them.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">Facilities:<br/>The team practices everyday from 4:30-8:30 at the Cricket ground (In front of IIT hospital) and the nets have floodlight facility available for practicing after daylight. We have got the  best equipments one can play cricket with. We believe that in order to become better you need to implement what you practice so after practicing during the weekdays we play matches against other colleges during the weekend.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em;">Cricket never stops here as we are busy with tournaments all year around. Although we prepare for INTER IIT and Sportech throughout the year we also participate in other college tournaments. In order to extract talent out we have intra-college tournaments like Inter - Hostel and IITPL in the even semester. IITPL (A professional league within IIT Delhi similar to IPL, where we had auctions too) was introduced just last year and the tournament was a great success with a lot of good players emerging out.  So there are a lot of opportunities provided you just need to grab them. See you in the field (We request you to come to the ground in shorts/tracks :D).</p>
