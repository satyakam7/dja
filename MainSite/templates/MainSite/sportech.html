<h1>Sportech</h1>

<p>Sportech is the largest college sports festival in North India with participation from colleges across the country. It is one of the most prestigious events for college sports teams where they prepare to come and win big amongst competition from colleges like IIT BHU, IIT Kanpur, BITS Pilani to colleges from Punjab, Haryana, UP and our DU colleges. The events have a very wide span where we see lots and lots of sporting events chosen from 11 sports like Cricket, Football, Badminton and also lots of informal events in order to make the fest a fun experience even for people who aren’t very good at sports.  </p>

<h1 style="margin-top: 1em;">Sportech 2019</h1>

<p>Sportech 2019, IIT Delhi’s very own sports extravaganza was no less than a box full of surprises! This year, it was not just about sports but about the deeper aspect of well-being and enjoyment that sports activities unfurl. Sportech this year was the proud host of 45 colleges, 160 teams, 1500 participants and many more memories.</p>
<!--<p>The biggest milestone that Sportech should flaunt is hosting four matches of the T20 World Cup 2017 for the Blind in collaboration with the World Blind Cricket Council. Despite having minor exams, the spectator turnout for the same was truly spectacular. The very idea of promoting sports for the ‘differently abled’ and increasing the social sensitivity and acceptance for the cause was heartwarming.</p> -->
<p>Other major attractions of Sportech 2017 were the wide array of Informal Events that they put out. Ranging from a trip to the Indian Mountaineering Foundation, with people trying rock climbing, wall climbing and bridge crossing to Match Screenings of nail biting matches like the Australian Open Final between Federer and Nadal, EFL Cup Final. The Sports Quiz hosted by Quiz Master Suresh Menon was another success story in itself! Sportech Weekenders were a series of sports events organised every weekend for all the sports fanatics. These weekenders bragged of events such as Kho-Kho, Handball, Ultimate Frisbee, Skateboarding, Baseball, Rugby and many more. If that wasn’t enough, an Informals Night was organised where all participants stunned us with many of their dance moves. </p>
<p>Sportech 2019 was seen to promote a number of unconventional sports. The very idea of making people aware as well as appreciate these sports was in itself an inspiration for all sports fests. Women's Football Exhibition Match between the ladies of Ashoka University and Vasant Valley School was met with great appreciation. We also got to witness Tanvie Hans, the player who has represented Tottenham and Fulham Ladies Football Club. This was also followed by Baseball and Rugby training sessions and matches. The exhibition match for Rugby was played by the Indian National Rugby Team. Other prominent informal events were Kite Flying, Cyclothon, Run in the Dark, Blind Chess tournament and many more on this seemingly endless list!</p>
<p>The social campaign 'Prabuddha' meaning ‘being free of stress’ spoke about reaching out to the ‘differently abled’ and understanding the impact of sports on the mental as well as physical health through many events under it. Sportech organised a marathon for the mentally disabled children in collaboration with Volunteer4India along with motivational speech by Divyanshu Ganatara, who holds the record of doing all adventure spots as well as trekking up till the base camp for Mount Everest despite being visually impaired. Organised as part of the social campaign the Zumba Session and Cricket for Security Guards saw good participation and were greatly applauded. The Online Campaign regarding the impact of sports on the mental health also aimed towards creating a deeper social impact. </p>
<p>And last but not the least, the Formal Events. Ranging from Athletics to Basketball to Squash, 17 sport tournaments saw enthusiastic participation from all the teams. The arrangements as well as facilities for each sport were made well up to the mark in order to ensure a smooth tournament. Amongst all this, IIT Delhi also left it’s mark by performing extraordinarily well and ensuring a good and healthy tournament for all.</p>
<p>The hard work, the effort and the sleepless nights put in to organise this fest was truly evident by the outcome of Sportech 2019. With 1500 participants, 160+ teams, 45+ colleges, Sportech 2017 was one of the best sports festivals organised by IIT Delhi in it’s history. We greatly congratulate and appreciate the efforts of the organising team for being able to pull off such a wonderful tournament and giving us all the opportunity to peek into the world of sports! </p>
