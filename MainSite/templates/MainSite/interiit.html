    <p> Passion meets purpose at the Annual Inter-IIT Sports Meet, which is the grandest stage to showcase your sporting talents.
        The pride of representing the institute at such a stage is beyond words, itâ€™s a mix of a extravagant experiences and emotions.
        Hosted jointly by IIT Kharagpur and IIT Bhubaneswar this year, 14-22 December, and the Aquatics meet being hosted from 1-4 October.
        Why is it so important this year? IIT Delhi grabbed the first position in Overall General Championship in the Inter IIT Sports Meet 2018 in Guwahati, and we hope to hold back first position this December.
        The contingent is determined and practicing hard to bring home the general championship back this year.</p>
